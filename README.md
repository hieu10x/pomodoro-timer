# Pomodoro Timer

Welcome to the Pomodoro Timer project! This application helps you improve productivity and manage your time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. Whether you're studying, working, or practicing a hobby, the Pomodoro Timer can assist you in staying focused and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Technique**: The app follows the Pomodoro Technique, which involves breaking work into intervals of focused work (usually 25 minutes) followed by short breaks (usually 5 minutes). After completing a set number of intervals, a longer break is taken.

- **Notifications**: Get notified when each interval ends, even when the app is in the background.
